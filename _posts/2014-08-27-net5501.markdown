Debian (squeeze) on Soekris as firewall and proxy

We needed a firewall as well as a proxy caching server. The old desktop we were using as a proxy server was running debian and
squid proxy server. We wanted something more compact preferably running debian.  

We decided to use <a href="http://soekris.com"> soekris engineering's </a>  net5501. The net5501 configuration is 450 MHZ Geode processor, 256 MB RAM, L1 Cache 128KB, 
L2 Cache 128KB. The device can boot from a compact flash but we are using a 2.5" 320 GB laptop harddrive. We installed debian squeeze
on the device. 

We are running squid proxy server,
