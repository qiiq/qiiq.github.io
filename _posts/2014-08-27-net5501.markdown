Problem	
We needed a firewall as well as a proxy caching server. The old desktop we were using as a proxy server was running debian and
squid proxy server. We wanted something more compact preferably running debian.  

Solution
We went with Soekris engineering's net5501. The net5501 configuration is 450 MHZ Geode processor, 256 MB RAM, L1 Cache 128KB, 
L2 Cache 128KB. The device can boot from a compact flash but we ended up using a 2.5" 320 GB laptop harddrive.
